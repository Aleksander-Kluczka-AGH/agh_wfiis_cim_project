# Computational Intelligence Methods Project
MATLAB project written for Computational Intelligence Methods SŁ's course.  
Semester 6, year 2022.

## Topic
The exercise of this project is to use Fuzzy Logic system to classify IRIS, WINE and SEEDS datasets found on [UC MLR archive](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php). To improve the resulting classification success rate, the project includes an optimization algorithm.

## Colliding Bodies Optimization
> Novel efficient meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO) is based on one-dimensional collisions between bodies, with each agent solution being considered as an object or body with mass. After a collision of two moving bodies having specified masses and velocities, these bodies are separated with new velocities. This collision causes the agents to move toward better positions in the search space. CBO utilizes simple formulation to find minimum or maximum of functions and does not depend on any internal parameter.
